**Roadmap / Next Steps:** <p/>

- fix slightly screen tearing in mapping since edgeblend is introduces(coming soon, as workaround use mapperFBO..) <p/>
- add mapper sync and alternative sync (coming soon..)  <p/>

<p/>
- Add gender recognition based on openCV to trigger gender based content <p/>
- Add scripts to trigger content based on humidity/temperature <p/>
- Add Buttons to trigger dmxshow together with videoplayer sync (already works with osc/scheduler, sync might cause a lot of webtraffic) <p/>
- manual start of ken-burns slideshow (currently only with autostart) <p/>
- slideshow with different times of images depending on number in file-name of image  <p/>
- play images and videos after each other, depending on filename or with an ofx timeline  <p/>
- System alive ping, which sends out an email every 5 minutes to tell that beamer&pocketvj is alive, alarm function. <p/>
- AES67 Support, is it possible (https://github.com/dewiweb/ALSA-RAVENNA-AES67-Driver) Edit: Dante USB-donles are supported <p/>
- Add DMX in control commands to control the video player/mapper with DMX <p/>
- Automount and connect to usb lte modems for remote internet<p/>
- Complete authors file <p/>
- parse dmx sequences from *cough* software to playback on PocketVj (similar to mapping converter <p/>
- think about adding sonic pi <p/>
- make https://dicaffeine.com/ working with our linux version and talk to dev about licensing <p/>

<p/>
